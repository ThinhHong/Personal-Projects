# Stuff
- any questions?
- assignment #1
- assignment #2

# Assignments
- Again, write it like a report to your boss
    - no results hanging around without explanation
    - if you show something there should be a reason
    - alternatively, simply saying 'yes' is not enough. 
        - Plots help, so do sentences.
    - be careful with labeling of axes.
    - be careful of losing data 
        - if you start out with 46 rows and end up with 23, you better explain why
    - figure out what you are gong to do about ties and make your sentences and code match
    - if you have a reference for something, please indicate where it was used, eg # ref 1
    - hiding code with echo=false is a bad idea because when you are explaining what went wrong to your boss you won't recall what the hidden code did
- Show **Donor Base Size**

# About the project
- team project  
- expecting rmd & html slides  
- about 4 slides, 5 min presenting, 5 min questions   
- what, why, how  
- timeline:
  - need topic approved by me (in writing, via email)  
  - this may take several iterations  
  - don't attempt to get my approval Oct 6.  
  - present on Oct 7   

# How to do slides in knitr

# How to learn this stuff
- read the code  
- look up any functions you don't know  
- build small examples  
- execute line by line
- tribble is your friend


# RStudio Projects
- why  
- how  


# Homework (Individual) 
- Part I
    - I want a plot that shows me, for each ward, the fraction of the precincts where the winner of the ward beat the runner up in the ward.
    - The plot should show all wards, be properly labeled, easy to read, etc.
    - The doc should use the template, and write it up like it is going to your (potential) boss
    - Grading on this homework will be according to the rubric in the course outline...and will be tougher than the first one!
- Part II
    - I tossed a coin and got these results:
        x <- c("t", "t", "h", "t", "h", "h", "t", "t", "t", "t", "t", "t", "h", "h", "t", "h", "t", "t", "t", "t", "t", "h", "t", "t", "h", "t")
    - Do a **different** hypothesis test to see if the coin is fair
        - note just calculating by hand what one of the built in functions does is **not** different
    - Please be painfully explicit about what you are assuming
- due Oct 1, 23:59


# Tonight
- We will discuss writing your own functions
- We will discuss writing loops
- We will discuss pulling things out of data frames using positions
- We will discuss a bunch of useful functions
