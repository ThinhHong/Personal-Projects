Another possible factor is the  parental level of education. As the level of education a subject has shows their level of knowledge which can then lead to higher test results. Gender, race/ethinicty and lunch are believed to have no effect on test results since a subjects gender/race does not effect their knowledge. Lunch is also thought to have 0 effect as purchasing lunch has no effect on intelligence."
