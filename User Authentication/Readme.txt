User Verification Application
This Python application allows you to verify users using different encryption and encoding algorithms. The encrypted user data is then securely stored in a SQL database for further processing and analysis.

Features
User registration: Users can create an account by providing their personal information such as name, email, and password.
User login: Registered users can log in using their credentials to access the application's features.
Encryption and encoding: The application supports various encryption and encoding algorithms to securely store user data.
SQL database integration: Encrypted user data is stored in a SQL database for persistent storage and retrieval.

Supported Encryption and Encoding Algorithms
The application supports the following encryption and encoding algorithms for user data:

Cipher encryption
Base64 encoding
Transpose encryption
XOR encryption
