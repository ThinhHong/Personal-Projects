    "In League of Legends, win prediction is important because it allows players to have a better understanding of their chances of winning a game. By predicting the outcome of a match, players can adjust their gameplay and strategy accordingly, maximizing their chances of success. League of legends is almost 15 years old with a long list of players trying to become the best overtime. Where being high rank can bring prestige, fame and even money sometimes. As the top players can build communites around their ranks\n",
    "\n",
    "Win prediction is particularly important in ranked play, where players compete against others of similar skill levels to climb the ladder and achieve higher rankings. In this context, every win counts, and being able to accurately predict the outcome of a game can be the difference between gaining or losing valuable ranking points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Win prediction also helps players identify potential areas of improvement in their gameplay. For example, if a player consistently loses games where win prediction algorithms suggest they should have won, it may be an indication that they need to work on certain aspects of their playstyle, such as decision-making or team coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, win prediction in League of Legends is a valuable tool for players looking to improve their chances of winning games and climbing the rankings. It allows players to adjust their gameplay and identify areas of improvement, ultimately leading to a more rewarding and successful experience in the game."

    "In League of Legends, the blue and red sides are assigned randomly to teams in each game. While both sides have identical structure layouts, some players argue that the a certain side may have a slight advantage due to its camera angle and placement on the map. In this dataframe, red side has a slighty higher win rate than blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the red side's placement on the map can also be an advantage in certain scenarios. For example, the red side's bottom side has easier access to the dragon pit, a critical objective in the early game. This can make it easier for the red team to contest and secure early dragons, which can give them a significant advantage as the game progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that any advantage conferred by the red side is relatively small and may be offset by other factors such as individual skill and team composition. Furthermore, statistics suggest that the win rate difference between the blue and red sides is relatively small and varies depending on the region and skill level of players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, while the red side may have a slight advantage due to its camera angle and placement on the map, it's unlikely to significantly impact win rates in the long run."
