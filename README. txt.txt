Chronological Order   Program written in			Short description

Data Structures		Java		 Design and implements list interface to create a linked list with differet methods to alter the linked list.
					 As well as creating a stack structure with methods  to create a calculcator and towers of hanoi game.

Turnout analysis	Rstudio		 By studying the data in the statementofvotescastoctober242018.xls, it is being deterrmined if that as the number of 						 people per household increases, the relative amount of votes for the winner decreases in version1.
					 Version 2 : analyzes if the winner and runner up are close in votes, there will be more votes
					 Version 3 : Similar to version 2 except it analyzes every precint
				
Machine Learning 	Python		 Anaylzed a dataset with 1000 entries to implement supervised machine learning Dataset was trained and tested using 						 Naive bayes, Logitic regression and Multiperceptron. Results were then evaluated using precision recalled measures.

Triglyceride analysis	Rstudio		 A linear model was done on triglyecride data containing 250 entries from a hospital. Dataset was analyzed to deterine 						 valididity using histrogram plots,qq plot, residuals, leverage/outliers, covariance and variable selection.
						
League of legends API	Python		 An ETL pipeline was constructed using Riot's API to gather various leaugue of legends data to a SQL database. 
					 Data was processed using Python Pandas and then analyzed in various ways such as visualiztion champion win rate and 						 play rate using an interactive scatter plot using ploty. Utilizing Sklearn, machine learning models such as MLP were 						 used to predict based on certain factors, which team would win the match. Validity of dataset is also analyzed by using 					  qq plots, covriance and leverage/outliers. A website was constructed so that a user can ask for the winrate/playrate of 					          a champion or predict which team will win based on their current data. Matplotlib and seaborn were also used to 						visulize data and determine data validity.
